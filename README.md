# world_time

A new Flutter application.I used Dart as a programming language for this. Dart makes it easy to write efficient Object oriented code. The efficiency and simplicity of using dart and flutter is displayed in this project.
This porject can help people to know the time in different time zones. 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
## Problem Statement 
When I was in my High School, i faced regular problem of keeping track of my online courses that used to take place at odd times i.e., London instead of India and US Time instead of India.
There was a Google Clocks application but it did not have a seperate way to organize the event according to the class schedule based on different time zones. I had to select a specific time zone. So, me and my friends started coding a solution to the problem which became this project.
## Detailed Analysis 
I want a solution which would show me the time from different contries and let me set up an alarm through time of any couintry I want.
